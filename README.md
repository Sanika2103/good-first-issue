# Hey Dhruva Here !!
  This is a small effort by me to teach some of the required things for using gitHub.
  I myself am not an expert but still as is the case with Open Source, Every little contributon counts
  I know you will be able to learn the rest of the things by exploring github on your own
  
  
## Lets get Started !!

## Objectives 
1. To Learn How to Fork a Repo 
2. To Learn How to Clone a Repo in Local System
3. To Learn How to Create an issue
4. To Learn How to Commit changes in Codebase 
5. To Learn How to Create a pull request 

## Prerequisites 
1. Must have a laptop with an active internet connection
2. Must have git installed. If not then I suggest you look up a video on youtube for Installing GIT. [Recommended video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON5GAXubt_4) [Recommended Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkbK31dMNfM)
3. Must have a GitHub Account 
4. And thats it !!

## Steps To be Followed 
1. Open this repo from the link provided to you or from my profile 
2. As you see my name and then name of repo it means that this project is mine ( In simple language )
3. As this project is mine you  cannot make changes in it for this you have to Fork and Clone this project in your own system 
4. There is fork option on Top right side of page click on that. ( Your Project is Forked )
5. Then you will see green color code button click on that,you will see a link this link is used to clone our project in your local system with the help of gitbash
6. I am providing the link her just copy the statement in brackets and paste it in git bash. Sometimes ctrl + V dont work there  so we can use right click of mouse.
7. ( git clone https://github.com/Sanika2103/good-first-issue.git ) This will clone you repo and when you open your github now in repo you will see this repo with you name 
8. It means that its your copy of the code and you can make changes in it !!
9. Then you have to open the index.html file 
10. From this file you dont need to understand any code it just an example of codebase
11. You have to click the eidt (pencil) option and 
12. You have  to scroll down and you will get the below code 
13. 
        <h3>No:-1</h3>
        <h3>Name:-Dhruva Raj</h3> 
        <h3>Remark:-Yes !! I learnerd to Fork a Repo,Clone a Repo,Commit Changes in code and to make a PR !!</h3>
 13. You just have to copy the code and paste it below as the serial is going on.
 14. You have to update the data as index number which is going on and then you name and we can keep the same remark or you can also write your own !!
 15. This is just to help you learn how to make changes in code 
 16. Then you have to write what you have changed in this code For eg:- Updated FirstContribution.txt
 17. Then you have to click on commit changes 
 18. This will make changes in your codebase but as i am the owner of projects they should be reflected in mine to 
 19. For this you have to create a pull request.
 20. You have to go to Pull request section and then click on new pull request. 
 21. And Tell about changes you did and something link that 
 22. Then after creating sucessfull request it will be checked by me and then merged
 23. Like this you will be able to  Learn about GIT-Basic
